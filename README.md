# spaceinvasion

Welcome to spaceinvasion, a project written in Verilog for the capstone project of Elements of Computing Systems 1, F25.  

This project is very similar to something like Space Invaders, but is a lot worse.  

The base files (`lfsr.v`, `sprite_bitmap.v`, `sprite_renderer.v`, and `hsync_generator.v`) are all template files slightly modified from [8bitworkshop](https://8bitworkshop.com/).  

To run this project, I recommend creating a project in 8bitworkshop and importing `spaceinvasion.v`.

Yes, I know the project is not done.
